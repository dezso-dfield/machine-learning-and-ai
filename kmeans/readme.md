# K-Means Clustering Scripts

This repository contains two scripts for learning and experimenting with the K-Means clustering algorithm.

---

## 1. `preview.py`  
**Visual Demonstration**

This script shows how K-Means works step by step with randomly generated clusters.  
It animates how centroids move, how data points get reassigned, and how cluster boundaries change.

### Run
```bash
python preview.py
